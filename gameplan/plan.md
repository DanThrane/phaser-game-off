# GAME PLAN

## Idea
Refer to [the original proposal](/proposals/realmofthemadgod.md) for the original game idea.

## Story
What's the _story_?
Story ideas (actually more like plot ideas but whatever):
 - (Fantasy) The Thusand Year (evil) king returns from his long slumper to take over the world with his demon (or undead) armies
 - (Post-apocalyptic (possible)) An odyssey tale about your tribe, striken by horrible mutations from their expose to the waste that seemed totally ok to settle in at first, desperate attempt to get to a promised land (e.g. a land were they wouldn't die out) 
 - (Sci-fi) A rouge advanced AI has taken over a robot production facility and you, and your group, the Special AI Containment Unit, is sent in to deal with the AI's mischief

## Prototype
Elements that we want in the prototype:

 - [X] Top down sandbox world (camera follows player) (Already done in current code. Otherwise `this.cameras.main.startFollow(player, true);`)
 - [X] Level spec: read a level from a textfile (tile based, right)
 - [ ] Basic objects: solid block (stone, wall, etc.) (Wall done)
 - [ ] At least 1 boss
 - [ ] At least 1 small (type of) enemy
 - [ ] Basic combat gameplay (attack with mouseclick or whatever)
 - [ ] Basic graphics (go for very simple art or geometric objects in easy distinguishable colors)
 - [ ] Hybrid-gameplay (2 slots for abilities, can be swapped (or assigned if starting with none) when defeating a boss (ability defined by boss))

Insert your name/handle/username in square brackets if you want to assign yourself to a task.

## Post prototype
Elements that we want in the game, but can skip for the prototype

 - [ ] Dungeons (entrances and exits to smaller worlds)
 - [ ] Start screen (loading screen)
 - [ ] Controls screen (options menu, maybe)
 - [ ] Game over screen
 - [ ] Different items (weapons, health, ammo, etc.)
 - [ ] Graphics!
 - [ ] Sound
 - [ ] All those small things and effects that make a game great (screen shake, weapon recoil / flash, damage push back, etc.)

## Awesome to have
Elements that would make this game _killer_!

 - [ ] Multiplayer
 - [ ] Better graphics ( ;) )
 - [ ] Tutorial
 - [ ] Well balanced gameplay
 - [ ] Lots of content (5+ bosses to complete, wide array of items, enemies, etc.)
 - [ ] Auto generated world / dungeons
 - [ ] Mini map
 - [ ] Game play story (written or better: small movie with speech and sound effects)
 - [ ] NPC's (co-op with the computer if multiplayer is too hard)

## Code structure
We should aim for a decent structure for the game, such that it is not a total pain to develop.
Since we are several developers, this is vital if we are to understand the code.

Take a look at @SneManden's game: [Zeus](https://github.com/SneManden/zeus).
It was done somewhat recently and have a nice enough structure that we can build upon.
Very simply put: make sure to develop object oriented.

We will probably need a base character class that can be extended for enemies and players.
